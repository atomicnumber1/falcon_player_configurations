# LongShort-ButtonReleased
#
# This script is used in conjunction with the LongShort-ButtonPressed
# script to allow a single button to serve two functions.  When the button
# is held for a short period of time, the first action is performed and when
# the button is held for a long period of time, the second action is
# performed.  This script checks the time when the button is released and
# compares it against the time when the button was pressed.  If the duration
# was longer than the "LONGPRESS" value then the Long action is performed,
# otherwise the Short action is performed.
#
# You will need to edit 3 places in this script.  The first is the LONGPRESS
# value below this comment.  This value is in milliseconds, so '2000'
# indicates the button must be pressed for 2 seconds or more.  The other
# two locations to modify are at the bottom of the script.  These will be
# the short and long actions to take when the button is released.
